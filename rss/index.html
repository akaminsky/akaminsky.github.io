I started looking for a new job about a month after my current company at the time, Aereo, lost their case at the Supreme Court. I was perusing the job listings and kept coming across the job post <em>UX Designer at Booking.com</em>. </p>

<p>Since I have started working, two years ago, I have been anti-corporation / anti-big team. The first job that I had after college was at a company called Pingg, a start up with a team of 10 people. I absolutely loved my time and the people at Pingg. Pingg was bought by a big corporation and many things that I loved about the start up life changed. After a couple of months, I moved on to Aereo. I knew taking the job was risky because they were involved in legal battles, but I thought it was worth the risk. I believed in the company's mission, liked the team, and was happy to be back in the start up world. Unfortunately 3 months into my new job, we were shut down by the Supreme Court. </p>

<p>I stayed at Aereo for 6 months after we were shut down. There were some glimmers of hope here and there, but nothing concrete. After a while, I felt like I was wasting my time. I wanted to be learning and working, not just sitting on my hands. </p>

<p>So after doing some interviews, I finally manned up and applied for the UX Designer job at Booking.com. Even though it was a large corporation, there was one paragraph in the job post that really stood out to me: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Our guiding principle is that by helping our users we help our business. As a designer in our Front End team you'll be a key part of the idea generation process, working in a small startup-like group which takes full ownership of their part of our platform. You'll work with developers, product owners, copywriters and user researchers to conceive, analyse, hand code &amp; test your ideas.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is exactly what I like to do. I love starting with an idea and following that idea from creation to production. On the first phone interview, I made sure to ask if this was really the way that they worked. The interviewer said yes so I continued on with the process. After the first interview, I already started to have anxiety. Am I really doing this? Am I really applying to a job in a different country? Well after another phone interview, and an in-person interview in Amsterdam, I am really doing this. </p>

<p>So did Amsterdam have anything to do with the job, yes of course, but not until after I decided I actually liked the job itself. I have always liked the idea of taking a couple of years and living and working abroad but never thought that I would actually do it. I always thought, if I lived abroad it would be in London, but now I am happy that it is not London. I studied abroad in London and absolutely loved it. But, London is a lot like New York: major city, cabs, native language of English, a lot of the same stores and food. </p>

<p>In Amsterdam, I am hoping to get a very different cultural experience. Hopefully I will learn a new language, culture, try new food, get around on a bike, and travel throughout Europe. I am young and have nothing keeping me here in New York. I am a bit sad about leaving New York / America and I will obviously miss my family and friends, but it is the perfect time to take this opportunity. If I didn't take this job, I know that in 10 years, or even in a month, I would look back at this missed opportunity and kick myself. </p>]]></description><link>http://amsterdam.alexakaminsky.com/2014/10/29/why-amsterdam/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">02f2b1a2-8504-4df1-9b29-0deee9e18d72</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Alexa Kaminsky]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 30 Oct 2014 02:40:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Purpose Of This Blog]]></title><description><![CDATA[<p>For the past two years I have been using the app <a href="http://dayoneapp.com/" target="_blank">DayOne</a> to keep track of my day to day activities. I have over 400 entires (not patting myself on the back or anything). I highly recommend it. I will continue journaling but I wanted to start this blog to go deeper than:  </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"I woke up at 9:30, went to work and had pizza for dinner."   </p>
</blockquote>

<p>What I have learned from journaling is that I love to look back on it weeks or months later. I love reading an old entry, having that memory brought back, and reliving it. Instead of just reliving those moments, I want to remember my thought process, explore my emotions, and gain insight from my experiences.</p>

<p>I am starting this blog because my life is about to drastically change: Starting a new job as a UX Designer with <a href="http://www.booking.com/" target="_blank">Booking.com</a>; Moving to a new city / country / continent; Speaking a new language; Meeting new people; Figuring out a new government and rule system; Being open minded to trying new foods; And getting a new telephone number after 11 years. </p>

<p>I am not sure how long I will stay in Amsterdam. I say that I am giving it a maximum of 3 years but one never knows. 3 years ago I thought I was going to find a job in Atlanta and stay there after college. What I do know is what I hope to gain from this experience:</p>

<ul>
<li>to become fully independent</li>
<li>to travel travel travel</li>
<li>to gain a worldly perspective </li>
<li>to learn conversational dutch</li>
<li>to develop connections with people from all over the world</li>
<li>to become better at my job</li>
<li>and to travel</li>
</ul>

<p>Some things you should know if you are going to read this blog. I write like I talk. So if you are hoping to find some magnificently written blog this is not the place. If bad grammar bothers you, turn away now. I promise you I will mix up their and there, your and you're, and many many more. Also I am coding this site so there is no spell check. You've been warned.</p>

<p>Well that's it for now. The moving company is coming by my apartment tomorrow to do a pre-moving survey. Sh*ts gettings real. </p>]]></description><link>http://amsterdam.alexakaminsky.com/2014/10/22/purpose-of-this-blog/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">fef65773-876b-4cef-9718-0b2ae5fb2532</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Alexa Kaminsky]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 23 Oct 2014 03:41:40 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
