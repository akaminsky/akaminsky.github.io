## Step 2: Add It to Your Code

2. Find **line 429** (around there)
3. Replace `'YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET'` with your actual secret:

## ‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT Security Note

**This approach exposes your Client Secret in the browser code.**

### Is this okay?
- ‚úÖ **For personal use**: Yes, fine

- ‚ùå **For public/production apps**: No, use a backend (Netlify)

### What could happen?
- Someone could see your secret in the browser code
- They could use your Spotify API quota
- For personal use with low traffic, this is usually fine

## üéâ That's It!

Once you add your Client Secret:
1. Refresh the page
2. Open browser console (F12)
3. You should see: **"‚úÖ Spotify connected!"**
