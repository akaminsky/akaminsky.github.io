I am a Senior UX Designer at Booking.com. I am empathetic, open minded, collaborative, enthusiastic, responsible, adaptable, and motivated. I am passionate about producing relevant products that are rooted in solving user problems while meeting business needs. To solve the customer problem, I look at both qualitative and quantitive data to inform my design decisions. I see myself as the intersection between product and development; always championing the user but remembering what is import for the business. Bring people together from different teams and departments and motivating them to collaborate and work holistically on a product is one of my greatest strengths.

For the last four years Iâ€™ve been working to improve the experiences of our customers and accommodation partners.  My current focus is creating seamless experiences for the family traveler, helping them choose the most appropriate accommodation for their family needs and desires for the best value. To do this, we also need to build new products on the accommodation side of the business to enable our accommodation partners to properly describe, document, market, and sell their accommodation to families.
