          <h4>Booking.com - UX Designer</h4>
          <h5>January 2015 - present | <a href="http://www.booking.com" target="_blank">booking.com</a> | Amsterdam, NL</h5>
          <p>
            Sole UX designer for an internal CRM platform. Our team worked like a start up and took full ownership of our platform from concept to implementation. I spent 6 months researching, designing, implementing, and testing a tool to assist Account Managers efficiently plan their partner visits. I also designed an Android app so they could have access to the platform while on partner visits.

          <h4>Aereo - UX Designer &amp; Front End Developer</h4>
          <h5>March 2014 - November 2014 | <a href="http://www.aereo.com" target="_blank">aereo.com</a> | New York, NY</h5>
          <p>
            I designed and implemented an improved sign up flow through A/B testing, created landing pages that increased account sign ups, and created responsive email marketing campaigns through ExactTarget. I also worked closely with the CMO, director of product management, and creative team to wireframe concepts and develop the user flow for the next iteration of our platform. Unfortunately Aereo filed for Chapter 11 due to their legal battles, so our ideas never came to fruition.

          <h4>Pingg/Celebrations - UX Designer &amp; Front End Developer</h4>
          <h5>June 2012 - March 2014 | <a href="http://www.celebrations.com" target="_blank">celebrations.com</a> | New York, NY</h5>
          <p>
            I wireframed UI concepts, developed the user flows, and implemented the front-end in HAML, SASS, and LESS for three new products: Postal Pingg Greeting Card, Pingg Membership Program, and Social Greeting Card. Pingg was bought and merged with online content platform Celebrations.com. After the acquisition, we defined our new target audience and I was responsible for determining how the two were going to interact with each other and become one cohesive site.

          <h5>Fall 2015 | <a href="http://www.inventaprint.com" target="_blank">inventaprint.com</a> | New York, NY</h5>
          <p>
            Closely worked with the CEOs to understand their problem, define a scope, and bring their vision to life. The site that they wanted to build had two different user personas: the invetors and the makers. I figure out how the two personas interacted and differ from each other. From there, I defined the information architecture, user flows, and created the wireframes for each page of the site.

          <p>
            Worked with a small team of 2 developers and a product manager. Within the first two weeks, we met with the clients to establish their needs for the site and I designed the information architecture and wireframes for the member, non member, and administrator facets of the site. The wireframes were then sent to a design agency and then I applied the agency’s design to the site using HAML and SASS.

        <div class="job">
          <h4>yupmate.com</h4>
          <p>An idea for a roommate matching website. Instead of matching a person to someone who needs to sublet a room, people would be able to find a roommate first and then  look for housing on their own. I wireframed and went through key user flows and pages. Started developing yupmate to MVP with one of the developers I worked with at pingg. We brought it to our bosses at the time and they loved the idea but we decided to keep it as a side project for now. </p>
