        <section class="post-content">
            <p>I didn't wake up one day saying, okay I am going to work abroad. I started looking for a new job about a month after my current company at the time, Aereo, lost their case at the Supreme Court. I was perusing the job listings and kept coming across the job post <em>UX Designer at Booking.com</em>. </p>

<p>Since I have started working, two years ago, I have been anti-corporation / anti-big team. The first job that I had after college was at a company called Pingg, a start up with a team of 10 people. I absolutely loved my time and the people at Pingg. Pingg was bought by a big corporation and many things that I loved about the start up life changed. After a couple of months, I moved on to Aereo. I knew taking the job was risky because they were involved in legal battles, but I thought it was worth the risk. I believed in the company's mission, liked the team, and was happy to be back in the start up world. Unfortunately 3 months into my new job, we were shut down by the Supreme Court. </p>

<p>I stayed at Aereo for 6 months after we were shut down. There were some glimmers of hope here and there, but nothing concrete. After a while, I felt like I was wasting my time. I wanted to be learning and working, not just sitting on my hands. </p>

<p>So after doing some interviews, I finally manned up and applied for the UX Designer job at Booking.com. Even though it was a large corporation, there was one paragraph in the job post that really stood out to me: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Our guiding principle is that by helping our users we help our business. As a designer in our Front End team you'll be a key part of the idea generation process, working in a small startup-like group which takes full ownership of their part of our platform. You'll work with developers, product owners, copywriters and user researchers to conceive, analyse, hand code &amp; test your ideas.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is exactly what I like to do. I love starting with an idea and following that idea from creation to production. On the first phone interview, I made sure to ask if this was really the way that they worked. The interviewer said yes so I continued on with the process. After the first interview, I already started to have anxiety. Am I really doing this? Am I really applying to a job in a different country? Well after another phone interview, and an in-person interview in Amsterdam, I am really doing this. </p>

<p>So did Amsterdam have anything to do with the job, yes of course, but not until after I decided I actually liked the job itself. I have always liked the idea of taking a couple of years and living and working abroad but never thought that I would actually do it. I always thought, if I lived abroad it would be in London, but now I am happy that it is not London. I studied abroad in London and absolutely loved it. But, London is a lot like New York: major city, cabs, native language of English, a lot of the same stores and food. </p>

<p>In Amsterdam, I am hoping to get a very different cultural experience. Hopefully I will learn a new language, culture, try new food, get around on a bike, and travel throughout Europe. I am young and have nothing keeping me here in New York. I am a bit sad about leaving New York / America and I will obviously miss my family and friends, but it is the perfect time to take this opportunity. If I didn't take this job, I know that in 10 years, or even in a month, I would look back at this missed opportunity and kick myself. </p>
