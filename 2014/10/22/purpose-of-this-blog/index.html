        <section class="post-content">
            <p>For the past two years I have been using the app <a href="http://dayoneapp.com/" target="_blank">DayOne</a> to keep track of my day to day activities. I have over 400 entires (not patting myself on the back or anything). I highly recommend it. I will continue journaling but I wanted to start this blog to go deeper than:  </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"I woke up at 9:30, went to work and had pizza for dinner."   </p>
</blockquote>

<p>What I have learned from journaling is that I love to look back on it weeks or months later. I love reading an old entry, having that memory brought back, and reliving it. Instead of just reliving those moments, I want to remember my thought process, explore my emotions, and gain insight from my experiences.</p>

<p>I am starting this blog because my life is about to drastically change: Starting a new job as a UX Designer with <a href="http://www.booking.com" target="_blank">Booking.com</a>; Moving to a new city / country / continent; Speaking a new language; Meeting new people; Figuring out a new government and rule system; Being open minded to trying new foods; And getting a new telephone number after 11 years. </p>

<p>I am not sure how long I will stay in Amsterdam. I say that I am giving it a maximum of 3 years but one never knows. 3 years ago I thought I was going to find a job in Atlanta and stay there after college. What I do know is what I hope to gain from this experience:</p>

<ul>
<li>to become fully independent</li>
<li>to travel travel travel</li>
<li>to gain a worldly perspective </li>
<li>to learn conversational dutch</li>
<li>to develop connections with people from all over the world</li>
<li>to become better at my job</li>
<li>and to travel</li>
</ul>

<p>Some things you should know if you are going to read this blog. I write like I talk. So if you are hoping to find some magnificently written blog this is not the place. If bad grammar bothers you, turn away now. I promise you I will mix up their and there, your and you're, and many many more. Also I am coding this site so there is no spell check. You've been warned.</p>

<p>Well that's it for now. The moving company is coming by my apartment tomorrow to do a pre-moving survey. Sh*ts gettings real. </p>
